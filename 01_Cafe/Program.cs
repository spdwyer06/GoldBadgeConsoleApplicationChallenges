             Console app that is be able to: create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu

             The Menu Items:
                A meal number, so customers can say "I'll have the #5"
                A meal name
                A description
                A list of ingredients,
                A price
 

            Your Task:
                Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
                Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
                Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test your constructors or objects, just your methods)
                Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.
 

            Notes:
                We don't need to be able to update items right now.
